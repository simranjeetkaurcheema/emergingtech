<article><p align="right">Naturalists divide the class of birds, Greek name "aves," into two infraclasses: "palaeognathae" and "neognathae." Oddly enough, paleaeognathae, or "old jaws," includes birds that first evolved during the Cenozoic Era, after the dinosaurs went extinct—mostly ratites such as ostriches, emus, and kiwis. The neognathae, or "new jaws," can trace their roots much farther back into the Mesozoic Era, and includes all other types of birds, including the passerines mentioned in slide #2.

As mentioned in the previous slide, the evidence is now incontestable that birds evolved from dinosaurs—but there are still a lot of details about this process that have yet to be nailed down. For example, it's likely that birds evolved two or three times, independently, in the course of the Mesozoic Era, but only one of these lineages survived the K/T Extinction 65 million years ago and went on to spawn the ducks, doves, and penguins we all know and love today. (And if you're curious why modern birds aren't dinosaur-sized, that all comes down to the mechanics of powered flight and the vagaries of evolution).
